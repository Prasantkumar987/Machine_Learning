# College to Coperate
 I got best accuracy using **ExtraTrees Classifier** and accuracy is **0.8928**

### Problem Statement
With the growth in the number of educational institutes, the aim of every institute is to get their students placed in a good organization. Education institutes are also being evaluated by the students based on their placement performance.

Given that the training institutes have the records of former students and details of their placements, it is possible to apply machine learning techniques on this past data to make predictions on whether the students from the institute’s current batch are likely to be placed or not.

This will not only help the students to put in more effort in stepping into a career but also help the institution in providing the necessary infrastructure to these students to improve their chances of getting placed.

In this hackathon, you will have to identify some of the key factors that influence a student’s campus placement and also build a model based on the former students records that can predict how many of the current students in the institute are most likely to be placed.

### About Data
The provided datasets contain the student’s record like gender, stream of education, percentage marks at different levels of education, board etc

The data is divided into train and test data. 

The train dataset has the information of former students from the institute along with a status flag to indicate if the student was placed or not. 

The test dataset contains the information of the current students in the institute. 

The goal is to utilize the labelled train data and build a robust classification model to predict if the students in the test dataset are likely to be placed or not.
